My advisor led a Python crash course geared towards text processing for the Center of Excellence for Women & Technology that was held on February 18th and 19th. I assisted in this crash course along with another student. I wrote a Python script for using regular expressions to search a text file. Two versions were written, one that prints the output to terminal and another that uses Python to create a new output file. I also assisted with questions, helped the attendees set up and run the scripts, and helped the attendees when they were making their own scripts.
