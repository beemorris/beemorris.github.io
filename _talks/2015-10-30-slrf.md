40 native speakers and 10 L2 learners of English were presented canonical and adjectivally modified variants of VNP idioms and literal phrases in a combined judgment and reaction time task. Results were discussed adopting a constraint‐based view of bilingual idiom processing.

This was a paper presentation at The 34th Second Language Research Forum (SLRF) conference.

This work was done with Dr. Stefanie Wulff at the University of Florida.
