40 native speakers and 10 L2 learners of English were presented canonical and adjectivally modified variants of VNP idioms and literal phrases in a combined judgment and reaction time task. Results are discussed adopting a constraint‚Äêbased view of bilingual idiom processing.

This work was done with Dr. Stefanie Wulff at University of Florida.
