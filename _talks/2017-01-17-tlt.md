This research project focused on the idiom bite the bullet. The goal was to determine if there was any relationship between the usage of _bite the bullet_ and political meaning. The dataset consisted of 73 sentences that contained an idiomatic interpretation of _bite the bullet_. These sentences were annotated for parts of speech and then judged on whether they had political meaning without political context. The sentences were annotated so that variations of _bite the bullet_ could be analyzed to determine if a certain phrasing is more associated with political meaning than others.

This work was done as a final paper for L615: Corpus Linguistics at Indiana University. It was a poster presentation at the 15th International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories (TLT).
