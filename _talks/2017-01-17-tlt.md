This research project focuses on the idiom bite the bullet. The goal is to determine if there is any relationship between the usage of _bite the bullet_ and political meaning. The dataset consists of 73 sentences that contain an idiomatic interpretation of bite the bullet . These sentences were annotated for parts of speech and then judged on whether they had political meaning without political context. The sentences were annotated so that variations of bite the bullet could be analyzed to determine if a certain phrasing is more associated with political meaning than others.

This work was done as a final paper for L615: Corpus Linguistics at Indiana University. It was a poster presentation at the 15th International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories (TLT).
