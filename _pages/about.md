I am a full-time contract employee at TELUS International AI Data Solutions, contributing to NLP research and collaborating with product teams at Grammarly to annotate content and perform data quality control. I also provide feedback to the analytical linguists on annotation guidelines.

I am currently interested in transitioning into project management positions related to linguistics and technology.

I earned my M.A. in Computational Linguistics from IU, and my B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Florida.

I was a Ph.D. student and Doctoral Researcher at Indiana University. I majored in Computational Linguistics and minored in Informatics. My research interests included Dependency Parsing, Cross-lingual Parsing, Swedish, Universal Dependencies, Treebanks, Annotation, and Natural Language Processing.

My research focused on how much is lost when doing dependency parsing via model transfer of closely related languages when the parser is not optimized for the target language. The languages investigated were Swedish, Norwegian (Nynorsk), and Danish. 

I also led a Dependency Parsing Reading Group at IU for a year and a half.

I am currently working on getting my Pilates teaching certification. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and spending time with my cat. I am also trying to maintain the Swedish I learned during my semester abroad at Linköpings universitet.
