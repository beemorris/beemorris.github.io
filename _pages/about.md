I am a full-time contract employee collaborating on NLP research and with product teams for Grammarly.

I am currently interested in transitioning into management positions related to linguistics and technology.

I earned my M.A. in Computational Linguistics from IU, and my B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Florida. I am currently working on my qualifying exams. I have passed the first portion, and it focused on corpus linguistics.

I was a Ph.D. student and Doctoral Researcher at Indiana University. I majored in Computational Linguistics and minored in Informatics. My research interests included Dependency Parsing, Cross-lingual Parsing, Swedish, Universal Dependencies, Treebanks, and Natural Language Processing.

My research focused on how much is lost when doing dependency parsing via model transfer of closely related languages when the parser is not optimized for the target language. The languages investigated were Swedish, Norwegian (Nynorsk), and Danish. 

I also led a Dependency Parsing Reading Group at IU for a year and a half.

In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and spending time with my cat. I am also trying to maintain the Swedish I learned during my semester abroad at Linköpings universitet.
