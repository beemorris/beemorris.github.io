I am a computational linguist who loves language and technology.

I am a creative problem solver who loves to find answers. I excel at cross-team communication and collaboration, but I also work well independently. I thrive in an environment with evolving priorities and varying tasks.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, reading, playing video games, reading, and spending time with my cat.
