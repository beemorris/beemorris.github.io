I am a Ph.D. student at Indiana University. I major in Computational Linguistics with a minor in Informatics. My current research interests are Dependency Parsing, Cross-lingual Parsing, Swedish, Universal Dependencies, Treebanks, and Natural Language Processing.

I lead a Dependency Parsing Reading Group at IU.

I am currently an Associate Instructor at IU and am the solo instructor on record for undergraduate Syntax in the Linguistics department.

I earned my M.A. in Computational Linguistics from IU, and my B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Florida. I am currently working on my qualifying exams. I have passed the first portion, and it focused on corpus linguistics and the second one will investigate how much is lost with regards to performace when using closelty related languages when the parser is not optimized for the target language. The languages being evaluated are Swedish, Norwegian (Nynorsk), and Danish.

My second qual will lead into my dissertation, which will focus on improving Swedish dependency parsing and comparing/contrasting Swedish parsing results.

In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and spending time with my cat. I am also trying to maintain the Swedish I learned during my semester abroad at Linköpings universitet.
