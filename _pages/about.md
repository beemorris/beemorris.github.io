I am a computational linguist who loves language and technology. 

I am interested in transitioning into management positions related to linguistics and technology.

I am currently working on getting my Pilates teaching certification. I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and spending time with my cat. I am also trying to maintain the Swedish I learned during my semester abroad at Linköpings universitet.
