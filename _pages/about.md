I’m a computational linguist and senior localization engineer who loves the intersection of language, technology, and clear communication. I’m highly detail-oriented and especially drawn to the challenge of turning complex systems—localization workflows, file formats, developer tooling, and linguistic structures—into clear, well-structured documentation.

As an aspiring technical writer, I focus on accuracy, clarity, and thoughtful organization, bringing together my background in computational linguistics, engineering, and teaching to explain intricate concepts with precision.

Outside of work, I enjoy listening to music, reading, photography, playing video games, and spending time with my cat.
