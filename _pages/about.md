I am a Ph.D. student at Indiana University. I major in Computational Linguistics with a minor in Informatics. My current research interests are Dependency Parsing, Cross-lingual Parsing, Swedish, Universal Dependencies, Treebanks, and Natural Language Processing.

I lead a Dependency Parsing Reading Group at IU.

I earned my M.A. in Computational Linguistics from IU, and my B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Florida. I am currently working on my qualifying exams. One will focus on corpus linguistics and the other on improving Swedish dependency parsing.

My second qual will lead into my dissertation, which will focus on improving Swedish dependency parsing and comparing/contrasting Swedish parsing results.

I am also the Managing Editor at The LINGUIST List. I am also responsible for posting Career announcements, managing our Social Media and boosting announcements, and I am also the Invoicing Officer.

In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and spending time with my cat. I am also trying to maintain the Swedish I learned during my semester abroad at Link√∂pings universitet.
