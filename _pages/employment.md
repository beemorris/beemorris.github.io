I am currently a Doctoral Researcher at Indiana University.

I am also a full-time Linguistics Analyst II at TELUS International where I am collaborating on NLP research and with product teams for Grammarly to annotate content and perform data quality control. I am also assisting in the development of data and annotation guidelines. I also work with the product team to improve the feedback provided to users.

I have previously been an Associate Instructur and Research Assistant at IU and a Graduate Assistant at Indiana University via [The LINGUIST List](https://linguistlist.org/people/becca/).
