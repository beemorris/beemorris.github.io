I am currently a Senior Localization Engineer at LILT. 

I was the Linguist Lead at TELUS International AI Data Solutions, where I worked with an NDA-protected client.

I have previously been a Ph.D. Student, Doctoral Researcher, Associate Instructor and Research Assistant at IU, and a Graduate Assistant at Indiana University via [The LINGUIST List](https://linguistlist.org/people/becca/).
