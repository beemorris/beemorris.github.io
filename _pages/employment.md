I am a full-time contract employee at TELUS International. I am collaborating on NLP research and with product teams for Grammarly to annotate content and perform data quality control. I also provide feedback to the analytical linguists on annotation guidelines.

I have previously been a Ph.D. Student, Doctoral Researcher, Associate Instructur and Research Assistant at IU, and a Graduate Assistant at Indiana University via [The LINGUIST List](https://linguistlist.org/people/becca/).
